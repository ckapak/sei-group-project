​
## Overview
​
**You’ve come a long way, and it's time to show it.** This will be your most advanced project to date. It is __IMPORTANT__ to note that when we say _advanced_, the project doesn't necessarily need to have lots more functionality.
​
**Remember:** simple code is stable code, so always favour refactoring and bug fixing over adding more functionality.
​
With this in mind, you need to be smart about how you plan, limit your project scope to be achievable (in terms of functionality) and focus on quality rather than quantity.
​
Make sure you review your project proposal with your instructor so you can make sure it's **something you can accomplish in the limited time we have**. You will have some time after the project to add extra functionality before your Meet & Hire!

## Technical Requirements
​
You must:
​
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
