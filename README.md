​
## Overview
​ 'Out And About' is an application that allows users to search for free outdoor
events in London by simply entering the area they wish to visit, the date, time
and the event category. ​Once the user registers and logs in, they can join the event, send messages on the event board and create their own event.

## Technical Requirements
​
Here were the technical requirements of the project:
​
* **Build a full-stack application** by making your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** built with React
* **Be a complete product** which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple of models
* **Implement thoughtful user stories/wireframes** that are significant enough to help you know which features are core MVP and which you can cut
* **Have a visually impressive design** to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers. **ALLOW** time for this.
* **Be deployed online** so it's publicly accessible.
* **Have automated tests** for _at least_ one RESTful resource on the back-end. Improve your employability by demonstrating a good understanding of testing principals.
